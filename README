Ecommerce Search Cleanser

Using Python NLTK we can extract the following data from a sentence:
- Brands
- Merchants
- Price
- Description of the product such as color and more 

So if a person types in "I want a blue dress for 50 dollars", the cleanser will pick out the needed information such as blue, dress, and 50.
With that, it will relate the content to correct assignments for search purposes.
